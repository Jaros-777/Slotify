# 🛎️ Slotify

**Slotify** is a reservation system where businesses can register, post their service offers, and clients can book appointments directly through the platform. For example, a hair salon can create an account, list its services, and clients can schedule appointments online. The platform also features an admin panel for managing appointments, calendars, and system settings.
